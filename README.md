# Project Objective 
To provide a client with an insight into their web traffic through data sourced from google analytics over a six month period. They were particularly interested in user arrival, their journey whilst on the website and the page that they exited the website. The data in the public version of this project has been sythesised/replaced by generic terms as appropriate. 

# Project Outline
User Arrival:
- The most common keywords used in organic searches (the company name was anonymised with the word 'Company')
- The most common search engines (included all with over 1 hit)
- A graph showing which paid for ads were producing the most click-throughs 
- A graph showing the most common click throughs from social media companies. 

Goal Conversions:
- Features a date selector which updates all graphs on the tab

Exits:
