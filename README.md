# Project Objective 
To provide a client with an insight into their web traffic through data sourced from google analytics over a six month period. They were particularly interested in user arrival, their journey whilst on the website and the page that they exited the website. The data in the public version of this project has been sythesised/replaced by generic terms as appropriate. 

# Project Outline
User Arrival:

Looks at how users arrived on the site by analysing social media click throughs, adverts and organic searches.

Goal Conversions:

Looks at website usage that resulted in event bookings and when bookings were made

Exits: 

Looks at which page users exited on and how many pages they had visited before exiting.
